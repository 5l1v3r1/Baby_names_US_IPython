### U.S. Baby names iPython notebooks #

  * using data from United States Social Security Administration
  * I am making this public in case it gives a head start to those who want to explore this dataset, so they don't have to download and format the data and the python objects used to do preliminary analysis. Please let me know if you find this helpful!
  * I'm relatively new to Python; often my code is non-pythonic and I tend to use inefficient list iterations that are easy for me to code instead of comprehensions or Boolean indexing that would result in faster processing. Also, everything right now is in IPython notebooks instead of .py with classes, double underscores, etc., because it's more convenient for my workflow in data spelunking. Your mileage may vary, and constructive criticism is very welcome.
